                <p class="p__text"> Hello! I'm a Master's Computer Science student at the University of Florida and I'm currently in my third semester. I have showcased all the projects I have worked on
                    for the Designing Media Integrated Learning Environment course at UF. I have done a variety of projects relating to design (logos and covers), web quizzes and educatioinal videos!
                    I have previously worked as a fullstack software engineer and I had a lot of fun getting my hands dirty with HTML and CSS with all these projects.
                    I hope you find the content interesting and have as much fun going through them as I did making them!

					<p class="content-text">I worked on a book cover design for one of my favourite video games, God of War. I used GIMP for doing this and understood its basics. 
                        I also made a logo design for a fantasy book store named Enchanted Books and I used Inkscape to make this logo. I tried to make it the
                        logo of a bookstore I would have liked to visit when I was young.

					<h2 class="content-header">Web Design</h2>
					<p class="content-text">I made two web projects for this. One was a quiz about CSS and the properties we use to style webpages.
                        I had a lot of fun with this because I added features for remembering customer answers while moving between questions
                        as well as highlighting of the correct answer and alerting. The second one was a drag and drop quiz which I based on a
                        board game called Wingspan.

					<p class="content-text">We had to use IMovie to make an informational video and I chose to make it on fantasy books which
                        I loved reading as a child. I made a top 5 list which people could refer to if they were looking for something to read.
