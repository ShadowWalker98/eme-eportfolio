    <h1> Video Project: </h1>
    <p>
        I made a video on 5 wonders of the world because I was fascinated by them as a child. I used iMovie for making this video and added the following things to it:
        I added images for the different wonders of the world and resized them for the video.
        I used the Ken Burns effect provided by iMovie for each of the images in order to give them more dynamism.
        I added transitions like cross blur and cross dissolve in between the different images of the same wonder of the world and when they change I added fade to black.
        For the intro and outro I added circle in and circle out transition.
        For the intro and outro credits I added typewriter animation and pop down animation for the text using Canva.
        I also added closed captions for each of the wonders has a bottom left pop up text.
        I used the Evening soundtrack from Incompetech as the background music and recorded the narration using Voice memos installed on my macbook.
        I had a lot of fun working on this as I had never done video editing before and it taught me how much work goes into making a really polished video.
