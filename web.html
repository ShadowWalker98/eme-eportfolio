    <h1> CSS Quiz: </h1>
    <p>
        I made a quiz on the basics of CSS. It has different questions based on the properties of CSS used to modify the styling of a webpage.
        I made my own custom quiz script and html page and added styling to it using CSS. It is deployed on github pages.
        I wanted to keep the style minimalistic and simple so I decided to stick with the white background. I added a horizontal rule to separate the header text from the questions. I used flex and flexbox to arrange the layout of the different elements.
        I made the answer selection from a dropdown to a radio button group because I felt it made more sense that way as it was not a multiple answer question. All of my questions have 4 options but we can give different number of options for different questions.
        I opted to use color feedback instead of textual feedback so whenever we click on the check button, our option gets highlighted with green if its correct, otherwise our option is highlighted with red and the correct one is highlighted green. The highlights are only applied on the label and the border-radius property was used to make the edges rounded.
        I also added functionality to save responses for questions when we browse through the quiz. This helps keep track of the questions we have selected an option for. This was done with the help of an array to keep track of the selected options.

    <h1> Drag and Drop Wingspan game: </h1>
    <p>
        I play a board game called wingspan with my friends in which we have to place different birds according to their characteristics. I made a habitat game based on this in which we have to classify the birds into their correct habitats.
        Some of the changes I made were:
        Center aligned the div in which we have all the elements.
        Changed the list items to bird names and the headings of the boxes to the different types of habitats.
        Added more birds and assigned them to the correct answer box.
        Changed the background color of the main container and the body to match the board game's theme colour.
        Changed the message which shows up when the player wins.
        Changed the maximum answers for each habitat to 5.
        Changed the border of the list items to dotted and rounded the edges.
        It was a fun project but the javascript was confusing as it was not in a separate file and embedded directly into the html file..
